I am a second‑year PhD student in the [Department of Geography](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/about){target="_blank"} and a Master’s candidate in the Probability and Statistics (PSTAT) department at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB).

Previously, I earned a Master’s in Environmental Science and Management from UCSB’s Bren School and a Bachelor’s in Environmental Economics and Policy from UC Berkeley.

My research interests span the integration of advanced computational methods (including machine learning and statistical modeling), geospatial and remote‑sensing techniques, and interdisciplinary socioeconomic analysis to tackle complex challenges in food security, natural resource management, and climate resilience across diverse settings. I have interned at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), developing predictive models for high‑temperature alloys, and served as a grants officer for Global Fund for Women, managing diverse portfolios and liaising with a variety of stakeholders.

Within academia, I contribute as a teaching assistant and associate student instructor at UCSB, delivering content across multiple departments and disciplines.
